# Freeverse for Python
## A new way to write free-form, minimalistic specs (tests) in Python that favor natural language

I'm trying to pioneer a new style of specs. So far I have just slapped a bunch
of code together as a sort of brain dump. Soon it will be time to slow down and
begin to shape this code more carefully.

The basic idea is that you should be able to shape the specs how you want to around the shape of your code and of the natural language descriptions you want to use.
